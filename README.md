# Data science applications in Health Genomics
## Kevin Leempoel - TDI Capstone Project

As for now, machine learning and big data processing remains largely unexplored in health genomics and precision medicine.
But recent studies have demonstrated than machine learning applied to large clinical trials enables researchers and clinicians to create more accurate patient profiles, resulting in an improved diagnosis and treatments of  diseases.

For my capstone project, I aimed to evaluate the relevance of data science tools in Health Genomics and publish my findings,  scripts and interactive visualization tools. 
This work is relevant not only to other researchers but also to clinicians and the med tech industry in general.


## Description of the project
The project uses Machine Learning to predict
- 1. The Predisposition to genetic diseases in humans using a simulated dataset
- 2. Local adaptation of livestock using Cattle genetic data from Uganda

The project is described in detail [here](Explanation)


## Scripts
- Scripts can be found in `Scripts/` or directly through the [Project Description page](https://github.com/kleempoel/TDI_Milestone_KL/Explanation.html).

## Data
- Datasets for human simulations and Ugandan Cattle can be found in `Data/` and `UGBT/` respectively
